Hello,

I live in Brisbane Australia and work as an XPLAN developer in the financial services sector.

I’ve been into tech pretty much all my life and have been studying Machine Learning on and off in my own time since December 2017.

In 2019 I blogged about my experience learning the programming language Julia. [Click here if you're interested in this past journey.](https://spcman.github.io/getting-to-know-julia/)

My enthusiasm to experiment with machine learning has returned with the advent of AI Art.

This blog follows my new journey with AI Art and Video using Stable Diffusion and Python.  

Please follow my posts if you're like me and trying to avoid compute charges on Google’s Colab (and make the most your Mac's Silicon).

Note, if you have landed here to just experiment with AI Art and don't want to learn Python you may be better off installing something like [DiffusionBee](https://diffusionbee.com/).  This app was written for Mac's and is really easy to use.   

Also be sure to check out [Automatic1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Installation-on-Apple-Silicon) this is what I mainly use now.
