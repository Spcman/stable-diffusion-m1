I'll be honest, getting some of the Stable Diffusion notebooks written for PC GPU's working hasn’t been easy for me (so far) on the Mac Studio.  If you’re thinking of buying a new computer primarily for Machine Learning I’d consider a PC with Nvidia GPU first.  Most of the Python libraries used for Stable Diffusion were originally written for this ecosystem and you’ll definitely have less problems going down the PC path. That said Mac computers with Apple Silicon (M1/M2) have great potential and the developers are adding more and more support.

Read on to see how I go.
